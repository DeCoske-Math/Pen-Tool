# Pen-Tool
Automation + ML to assist with recon while narrowing attack vector



1. Define Core Features

Before jumping into development, decide on the essential features your tool will include. For example:
	•	Reconnaissance:
	•	Domain/IP scanning (e.g., subdomain enumeration, DNS lookups).
	•	Port scanning (e.g., with Nmap integration).
	•	Service detection (e.g., identifying running software on ports).
	•	Passive information gathering (e.g., WHOIS lookups, search engine scraping).
	•	Data Collection:
	•	Centralized database for storing scan results.
	•	Categorization of data (e.g., open ports, vulnerabilities).
	•	Export options (e.g., CSV, JSON, reports).
	•	Automation:
	•	Schedule tasks (e.g., nightly scans).
	•	Chain commands or scripts for repeatable workflows.
	•	GUI Features:
	•	User-friendly interface for inputting targets and viewing results.
	•	Dynamic updates for scan progress and results.
	•	Graphical data representation (e.g., charts for open ports, maps for geolocation).

2. Choose Your Tech Stack

	•	Programming Language:
	•	Python is highly recommended due to its vast library ecosystem for pentesting and ease of GUI development.
	•	GUI Frameworks:
	•	Tkinter: Simple, built-in with Python.
	•	PyQt / PySide: Advanced, with more customizable widgets and professional design.
	•	Kivy: Good for cross-platform development.
	•	Electron (JavaScript): If you’re comfortable with web technologies for desktop apps.
	•	Pentesting Libraries:
	•	scapy, shodan, socket, nmap, requests, subprocess (for running external tools).
	•	Database:
	•	SQLite for lightweight local storage.
	•	MongoDB or PostgreSQL if you want scalability.

3. Architecture Design

	•	Backend: Handles processes like scanning, interacting with APIs/tools, and managing data.
	•	Frontend (GUI): Allows users to input targets, start scans, and view results.
	•	Database Layer: Stores results for future reference and organization.

4. Develop Modules

Build your application in modular components to make it easy to develop, test, and expand.
	1.	Recon Module:
	•	Subdomain enumeration (e.g., integrate tools like amass or Sublist3r).
	•	WHOIS lookups.
	•	Port and service scanning.
	2.	Data Module:
	•	Store and retrieve scan results.
	•	Provide sorting and filtering options.
	3.	Automation Module:
	•	Allow users to schedule scans.
	•	Set up predefined workflows for common tasks.
	4.	GUI Module:
	•	Input forms for targets and options.
	•	Live output panel for results.
	•	Interactive charts or tables for data display.

 5. Tools to Integrate

You can integrate widely used pentesting tools like:
	•	Nmap: For network scanning.
	•	Shodan API: For IoT/device information.
	•	Metasploit: If you want exploitation options (be cautious of ethical and legal considerations).
	•	Nikto: For web server scanning.
	•	TheHarvester: For email, domain, and IP information gathering.
